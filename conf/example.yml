# -----------------------
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------

# Rename this file to "config.yml" before you start Tytanium,
# or copy the contents of this file to a file named "config.yml"
# that you made beforehand.

# NOTE: At the very minimum, you must set the value MasterKey under Security.

Storage: # Configure options relating to file storage.
  # If there is another directory you want to save files to (instead of "files" in the executable's
  # directory), then specify an absolute path here.
  Directory:
  # The size (in bytes) a file can be.
  # There will always be 2048 bytes added on top of this so that the server can respond.
  MaxSize:
  # The ID length to use. (e.g: xxxxx.png has an ID length of 5).
  # IDs are composed of alphanumeric characters only (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
  IDLength:
  # How many times an ID should be checked to see if a duplicate exists.
  # If it exceeds this number, the file is not created and returns an error instead.
  CollisionCheckAttempts:

RateLimit: # Limit the amount of requests users are allowed to make.
  # When to reset the rate limit imposed on an IP, in milliseconds.
  ResetAfter:
  Path: # Rate limits per path.
    # Handles the /upload path alone. This means that the rate limit for this path is exclusive to the path only.
    # If not specified there will be no rate limit for the upload path.
    Upload:
    # This is the GLOBAL rate limit.
    # All requests to the server are limited to this number, per minute.
    # If a per-route rate limit exceeds this number it will be overridden by this number.
    # If not specified a rate limit will not exist.
    Global:
  Bandwidth: # Limit the amount of data IPs can download/upload.
    # When to reset the bandwidth rate limit, in milliseconds.
    ResetAfter:
    # How many bytes an IP address can download/upload in the allotted time frame (specified by resetafter).
    # These default values are download 50 MB in 5 minutes or upload 250 MB in 5 minutes.
    # If they are not specified there will be no restrictions on bandwidth.
    Download:
    Upload:

Filter: # Configure which file types are allowed to be uploaded.
  # A list of mime types to block from loading completely.
  # If no values are given, a blacklist will not be set.
  # This default list blocks unknown file types and unwanted files (typically), mainly applications.
  Blacklist:
    - application/octet-stream
    - application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable
    - application/x-msdos-program
    - application/x-executable
    - application/x-sqlite3
    - application/x-object
    - application/x-elf
  # If this list is populated, then Tytanium will ONLY allow these mime types to be displayed.
  # If a mime type from this list is also in the sanitize list, it will be sanitized.
  # If a mime type from this list is also in the blacklist, it will be blacklisted anyway.
  # If no values are given, a whitelist will not be set.
  Whitelist:
  # A list of mime types to render as text/plain. Effective against documents like HTML to prevent phishing.
  # If no values are given, no mime types will be sanitized. It is highly recommended you at least keep text/html.
  Sanitize:
    - text/html
    - text/x-php
    - application/javascript
    - application/x-python
    - text/x-lua
    - text/x-perl

Security: # Options relating to security and authorization.
  # The key that allows uploading.
  MasterKey:

Server: # Configure the way the HTTP server behaves.
  # The port to listen on. The default is 3030.
  Port:
  # How many TOTAL requests the server can handle at once.
  # Requests will not be served to ANYONE if the # of simultaneous connections is above this number.
  # It is recommended you keep this value around 512 to avoid issues with high-traffic situations.
  Concurrency:
  # How long (in milliseconds) the server has to read the request body.
  # Default is 300000 (5 minutes).
  ReadTimeout:
  # How long (in milliseconds) the server has to write a response back to the client.
  # Default is 300000 (5 minutes).
  WriteTimeout:

Redis: # Configure the Redis connection. The values in this section are self-explanatory.
  URI:
  Password:
  DB: 0

# A boolean. Set this value to true if you want to have /stats show more data, including memory usage.
MoreStats:

# Force zero-width URLs, regardless or not if ?zerowidth=1 is specified in the POST request.
ForceZeroWidth: false

# How often (in milliseconds) the server should update the stats of the server. Default is 30000.
StatsCollectionInterval:

Logging: # Configure logging behavior.
  # Should events be logged to a text file in the first place? (Default is true)
  Enabled:

  # If logging is enabled, where should logs be written to? (Default is "log.txt" file in the project dir)
  LogFile:

Encryption: # Configure encryption behavior.
  # The length of the encryption key that is used in the query string (enc_key) when decoding files.
  # Try not to make it too long or URLs will be abnormally long.
  # By default, the length is 12.
  EncryptionKeyLength:

  # The string which helps in creating the encryption key for files.
  # You don't have to keep it private, and it can be any string.
  # Keep in mind that if you change this, files previously encrypted using this nonce will be impossible to decrypt.
  Nonce:

# The URL from which this server will be accessible from, for example, https://example.com.
# If you have multiple proxy domains, pick one of them to use here;
# it doesn't matter as long as it connects to the server.
Domain:
